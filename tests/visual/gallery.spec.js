// These baselines record how the site looks today; they do not endorse the design.

// One page per distinct layout. Adding more artwork pages would multiply baselines without
// covering new rendering paths — every artwork page uses the same template.
//
// `fullPage` is deliberate per page, not a default. A full-page capture of the 46-image home
// grid is a 6.7 MB PNG, and these baselines are committed: at that size a few redesigns would
// undo the repository slimming this project just did (Principle IV). The listing pages are
// captured at viewport size, which still covers the grid's layout, spacing, and palette,
// while the short pages are captured whole.

/**
 * Make image loading deterministic before screenshotting.
 *
 * The theme lazy-loads via lazysizes (`data-src` plus a 300ms opacity transition), which
 * only unveils images near the viewport. Measured on the home page: after scrolling the
 * full height and returning to the top, 7 of 46 images still had no `src` — lazysizes had
 * dropped them as out of range. A `fullPage` screenshot then captures blank tiles, and
 * *which* tiles are blank varies run to run. That is precisely the flakiness NFR-002
 * forbids, so this promotes every `data-src` to `src` directly and waits for decode
 * instead of negotiating with the lazy-loader's heuristics.
 *
 * The trade-off is explicit: these screenshots verify layout, colour, and typography, not
 * the lazy-loading mechanism. That mechanism is asserted separately below.
